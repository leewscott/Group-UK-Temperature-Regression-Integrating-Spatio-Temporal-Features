# Group United Kingdom Surface Temperature Regression Integrating Spatio-Temporal Features
Worked in a team (adhering to an agreed contract) to develop models for temperature prediction â€“ experimented with three standard regression architectures and one artificial neural network on a sampled ERA5 dataset. Developed a shared preprocessing pipeline for handling various types of data, investigated spatio temporal engineered feature performance impact and hyperparameter tuned models. Best model achieved a RMSE of 1.24 and R2 of 0.94.
